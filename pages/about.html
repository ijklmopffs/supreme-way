    <div class="about">
      <p>
        Every band has a story to tell, a unique one at that. This is what
        differentiates one brand from another over the course of its existence.
        With a brandâ€™s unique voice and story, they can easily attract and
        connect with their ideal audience in the digital world.
      </p>

      <p>
        Having this understanding, Amarachi uses her content writing skills to
        help brands position themselves online. Using different channels and
        platforms, she has consistently worked with businesses to ensure that
        they send out their unique content on different platforms.
      </p>

      <p>
        She has worked with several brands across many industries in the past
        three years. Some of those industries include food, transport and
        logistics, job platforms, E-commerce, education, fintech, and real
        estate. Providing different kinds of writing needs for these firms, she
        has helped them improve online visibility and also stand out amongst
        their competitors while attending to the pain points of their audience.
